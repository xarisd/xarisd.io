<p>
  Hi (again)! I am Theocharis (Haris) Dimitriou, born, raised and living in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki" rel="nofollow">beautiful Thessaloniki</a>, in Greece.
</p>

<p>
  I am a software engineer with over 15 years of experience in software systems implementations, having built various commercial enterprise systems for health, S.M.E.s, education, industry and culture and web APIs for fast pacing startups.
</p>

<p>
  I have a degree in Applied Informatics from <a href="http://www.uom.gr/index.php?newlang=eng" rel="nofollow">University of Macedonia</a>.
I worked as a Delphi, Oracle Forms, Java and .Net developer before falling in love with Ruby and recently with Python :-)
</p>

<p>When I'm not writing code or taking care of my family, I will be probably <em>trying</em> to work wood or speaking about (not only) Ruby and Python in the local <a href="http://thessrb.io" rel="nofollow">meetups</a>. I have just started to play around with Raspberry Pi and electronics.</p>

<p>You can contact me via <a href="http://twitter.com/xarisd" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a> or <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:xaris.dimitriou@gmail.com">email</a>, you can find my full cv at <a href="http://gr.linkedin.com/in/xarisd" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a> and view my code/projects on <a href="http://github.com/xarisd" rel="nofollow">Github</a>.</p>
