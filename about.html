<p>
  Hi (again)! I am Theocharis (Haris) Dimitriou, born, raised and living in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki" rel="nofollow">beautiful Thessaloniki</a>, in Greece.
</p>

<p>
  I am a software engineer with over 14 years of experience in software systems implementations, having built various commercial enterprise systems for health, S.M.E.s, education, industry and culture.
</p>

<p>
  I have a degree in Applied Informatics from <a href="http://www.uom.gr/index.php?newlang=eng" rel="nofollow">University of Macedonia</a>.
I worked as a Delphi, Oracle Forms, Java and .Net developer before seeing the light and becoming a Ruby developer :-)
</p>

<p>
  I am currently a co-founder and CTO at <a href="http://www.polyptychon.gr" rel="nofollow">Polyptychon</a>, an agency specializing in providing technology, content and exhibition services to culture and tourism organizations.
</p>

<p>When I'm not writing code or taking care of my family, I will be probably <em>trying</em> to work wood or speaking about (not only) Ruby in the local <a href="http://thessrb.io" rel="nofollow">meetups</a>.</p>

<p>You can contact me via <a href="http://twitter.com/xarisd" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a> or <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:xaris.dimitriou@gmail.com">email</a>, you can find my full cv at <a href="http://gr.linkedin.com/in/xarisd" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a> and view my code/projects on <a href="http://github.com/xarisd" rel="nofollow">Github</a>.</p>
